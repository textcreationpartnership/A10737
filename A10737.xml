            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD MADAME, there is ſuch a ſatietie, if not a ſurfet of books at this day, that it may bee thought as ſuperfluous to publiſh any new worke, as to carrie timber to the Wood, or water to the Sea. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I had neuer preſumed to ſet pen to paper, but only that I haue long deſired, to giue your Ladiſhip ſome teſtimonie of my thankefull heart, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours I haue receiued at your hands. And though I know, that as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaid of <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour,
<pb facs="tcp:20836:3"/>
you are moſt ſparing in prizing and valuing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits you beſtow, becauſe you giue them freely and put them not out to vſurie: yet if I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them, I might iuſtly be condemned of groſſe ingratitude. I acknowledge you haue opened euen the fountaine of your good opinion to me, which hath flowed as it were with a full ſtreame of pietie: and ſo many waies hath your vertue refreſhed and relieued me, that I may truly ſay, as once <hi>Furnius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I ſhall liue and die vnthankefull. For when I haue done all I can, I cannot ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the thanks which you deſerue. I am bold therefore, to preſent theſe poore fruits of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours vnto your Ladiſhip, to be a publike witneſſe and pledge to all poſteritie of my dutifull affection towards you. And though this paper-gift bee too baſe a recompenſe for your vndeſerued fauour; Yet it being the beſt which my pouertie can affoorde, I doubt not, but according to your milde diſpoſition, you will accept of it: reſpecting rather the affection of the giuer, then the worth of the gift, for if I were able to giue more I would performe it. I am not ignorant, that in publiſhing theſe my weake Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I ſhall expoſe my ſelfe to a thouſand cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of curious and carping Readers: but I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taxed of raſhneſſe in this behalfe, then iuſtly blamed for want of dutie. How meane ſoeuer they be, if they may any way benefit the Church of God; eſpecially, if they may be any ſmall meanes, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your godly endeauours in the way of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and to build you vp towards the Kingdome of heauen; I ſhall gaine that which I moſt deſire. And
<pb facs="tcp:20836:3"/>
thus I commend your Ladiſhip to God and to the Word of his grace: beſeeching him, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer good beginnings hee hath wrought in you, hee will perfit the ſame, vntill the comming of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> that your laſt worldly day may be your aſſured entrance to euerlaſting glorie.</p>

            <p>Now in theſe words the courſe of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is interrupted, to inſerte a briefe narration of the fall and repentance of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter:</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily

            <p>It is worthy to bee obſerued, that all the foure <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> doe diligently deſcribe this Story of <hi>Peters</hi> fall. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things there are, which ſome one of the <hi>Euangeliſts</hi> doe make mention of, which are omitted by all the reſt. But here, as if they had taken conſent, they all leaue this regiſtred to all poſteritie. Shall we thinke, that they are delighted in blaſing and publiſhing this horrible and ſhamefull fault of their fellow Apoſtle? Indeed carnall men loue to rippe vp other mens vices, either to ſatisfie their owne enuie and malice, whereby they are mooued to diſgrace and defame their brethren: or to commend their own righteouſneſſe and holineſſe aboue other men, as the proud Phariſie dealt with the poore <hi>Publican.</hi> But farre be it from vs to imagine,<note place="margin">

Secondly we may ſee in it the beginning and progreſſe of ſinne, how being yeelded to at the firſt, by degrees it commeth to the height.

Wicked gouernours of families for the moſt part haue all their ſeruants of their own dipoſition. According to the common prouerbe, <hi>Like maiſter like man.</hi> As the ointment that was powred on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, ran downe to his beard, and ſo to the very border of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So the impiety and wickedneſſe of the maiſter run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth about through the whole family, infecting and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all that are in it. It is in the family, as it is with a fiſh, that firſt taketh his infection at the head. And therefore as good Father <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid, If the head of the fiſh be ſweet, all the body is ſweet, but if the head ſtincke, all the body will ſoone be naught. So in like manner if the head of a family be good, it is a great meanes to make the whole family good; but if he be naught, there is little hope of all the reſt.

If he be profane, and make no conſcience of ſwearing and breaking the Saboth, his ſeruants will follow his ſteppes. Yea it may be obſerued, that let a man that is truely religious, or a godly miniſter, come into ſome houſes, where the maiſter is voide of the feare of God, and he ſhall be abuſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced of all the ſeruants, euen from the greateſt to the leaſt.

But the example of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that godly Captaine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2.7.</note> is moſt pregnant for this purpoſe. It is ſaid of him, that not onely his houſhould ſeruants, but euen his ſoldiers alſo (a very rare thing in theſe daies) feared God. It is very like they were not ſo at the firſt: but his good inſtructions and godly example had made them ſo. As we ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.19.</note> who had in his houſe 318. ſeruants, and all of them in ſome meaſure religious: for they all ſubmitted themſelues to be circumciſed by him.

If we would conſcionably vſe the ſame diligence, wee ſhould ſee the ſame bleſſing of God vpon our families, that it might be ſaid of them, as was ſaid of the houſes of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and <hi>Philemon,</hi> with others, that they are ſo many Churches of God.

So that they are ſo farre from being the Churches of God, as that they are rather the Chappels ofthe Deuill. For there is no care in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20836:18"/>
chuſing good ſeruants, and as little care in labouring by good meanes to make them good. If they be perſonable and ſeruiceable, ſuch as we may profitably imploy in our buſines, it is no matter what they are otherwiſe. Though they be neuer ſo vngodly, if they will doe their deed, as they ſay, they will ſerue the turne. Hence it commeth to paſſe, that maiſters are many times iuſtly plagued in their ſeruants. For 1. they are vnfaithfull in their buſineſſe, and deceiue their maiſters whereinſoeuer they truſt them. And indeed if they be vnfaithfull to God (as all irreligious perſons are) how can it be expected, that they ſhould be faithfull to man. Whereas if they were ſuch as feared God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.4.</note> they would make a conſcience of their buſineſſe, and bee faithfull and truſty in euery thing committed vnto them. As <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant, who being imployed by his maiſter, in a matter of great waight,<note place="margin">

For there is a fearefull curſe hanging ouer that houſe, where ſwearers and blaſphemers are intertained. Where as if they were godly, the bleſſing of God would be vpon all that they goe about. As euen <hi>Laban</hi> confeſſeth, that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued plainely, that God had bleſſed him in his eſtate for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſake. And when <hi>Putiphar</hi> had entertained <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to bee his ſeruant, <hi>the Lord bleſſed his houſe for</hi> Ioſephs <hi>ſake, and the bleſsing of the Lord was vpon all that he had, in the houſe and in the field.</hi> 3. they infect the whole family, as we ſee by too much experience; many children otherwiſe of good diſpoſition, haue bene poyſoned by conuerſing with diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

Nay wee will not admitte into our houſes, a ſeruant that hath the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſickneſſe, or any other contagious diſeaſe in his body. Much leſſe ſhould we admitte him that hath his ſoule loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely infected with notorious vices. 4. &amp; laſt of all they are a diſgrace and a reproach to their maiſters.<note place="margin">

And therefore in all theſe reſpects, let maiſters be carefull both to chuſe, and alſo to order their ſeruants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The maiſter in his family, ſhould performe all the offices of Chriſt in the Church. As a King, hee ſhould rule and gouerne thoſe that are vnder him, in the feare of God.

               </note> Therefore God doth worthily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe from vs, that when wee foole the want of his preſence wee may more earneſtly deſire him, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring may more diligently ſeeke him, and hauing once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him may at the laſt finde him to our greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, the Lord doth it to make vs more earneſtly to long after that full perfection of grace, that ſhalbe in the Kingdome of Heauen. If the Lord ſhould neuer denie vs grace in this life, nor ſhould be ouer ready to ſet downe our reſt here, and ſhould ſoone growe out of loue with any better eſtate. And therefore, that wee may not take the place of our baniſhment for our countrie as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, nor the earneſt of our inheritance for the full payment, the Bridegrome commeth and departeth by courſe: ſome times miniſtring comfort, and ſometimes changing our whole eſtate into weakneſſe. He ſuffereth vs to haue a little taſt how ſweet he is, but before we can fully feele it, he with draweth himſelfe, and as it were flouttereth ouer vs with his winges, to prouoke vs to ſlie vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But howſoeuer the Lord for theſe and other cauſes beſt knowne to himſelfe, doth forſake his children, for a while: yet this is our comfort, hee neuer forſaketh vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally nor finally. Yea euen when hee ſeemeth moſt of all to forſake vs, hee <hi>ſtandeth behinde the wall, and looketh at vs through the chinckes of the dore,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith. Where he compareth the Lord to a nurſe, that ſometimes hideth herſelfe from her child, to ſee what ſhift it can make
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20836:22"/>
without her: but ſtill her eye watcheth ouer it, that it take no hurt. So though the Lord, ſeeme to hide himſelfe from vs in ſome temptations: yet his gracious eye ſtill attendeth vs, and will not ſuffer vs <hi>to bee tempted aboue our ſtrength,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>but will giue an iſſue with the temptation.</hi> And if at any time wee feele our ſelues in danger of fainting, then hee runneth to vs with all ſpeed, and putteth his <hi>left hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our head, and his right hand doth embrace vs.</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.</note> as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth, yea let vs <hi>worke out our owne ſaluation with feare and trembling.</hi> It is true indeed,<note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, it admoniſheth vs to truſt in the Lord, that that which we are not able to doe of our ſelues, wee may effect it by his ſtrength, and by the power of his might. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration</hi> is an herbe of grace (as I may tearme it) that groweth not in our gardens, but as all other good gifts, it is <hi>from aboue,</hi>

               </note> it is very well worth our marking to conſider, what <hi>Ferus,</hi> who was himſelfe a Papiſt, hath written concerning this point in his commentaries vpon this place of <hi>Mathew.</hi> This place ſaith he, is a chiefe place of all that <hi>Mathew</hi> hath written: neither is there any place that doth more comfort the conſcience.

Now he is built vpon Chriſt, that beleeueth in Chriſt, and relieth on thoſe things which Chriſt is able to doe. The rocke then primarily is Chriſt, vpon whom the whole Church is built,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.</note> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Other foundation can no man lay; &amp;c.</hi> Againe, becauſe by true faith we are ioyned vnto Chriſt, and ſo doe alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort become ſtones or rockes, therefore alſo Chriſtian faith, and the firme and conſtant truth of the Goſpell, is that rocke whereupon Chriſt hath built his Church. He that reſteth vpon this faith, is a true member of the Church, in what place of the world ſoeuer he be. And he that knoweth not this faith, is no member of the Church, though hee ſeeme to be the chiefe in the Church. For the Church rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this truth, and the Church is but one. Thus far <hi>Ferus,</hi> which ſentence of his is agreeable and conſonant in all things to the doctrine of our Church, and indeed to the doctrine taught in the holy Scriptures.

            <p>This example of the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> fearefull fall doth teach vs, that there is no ſinne ſo grieuous nor ſo hainous, no wickedneſſe ſo odious and abhominable, but euen the deare child of God, being left to himſelfe, may fall into it, except the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.

So that hereby it is euident, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their outward eſtate, many times there is little or no difference, betweene the child of God and a reprobate. And this is true, Firſt before their conuerſion to God. When they liue in ſuch groſſe and notorious ſinnes as they may ſeeme euen to be ſhackled by the foote with reprobates. As may appeare in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who before her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion was a common ſtrumpet, and poſſeſſed with ſeuen Deuils.

were in times paſt vnwiſe, diſobedient, ſeruing luſts and diuerſe pleaſures, liuing in maliciouſneſſe and enuie &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe, he putteth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in minde,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.10.11.</note> what manner of perſons they had beene, before they were ſanctifyed, namely ſome of them had beene <hi>Idolaters, Adulterers, Buggerers, Theeues, Drunkards,</hi>

For the Lord <hi>Knoweth who are his,</hi> though they be hid, as it were, ouer head and eares among reprobates: but in reſpect of their outward conuerſation, there is no difference at all. Neither is this any whit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to their ſaluation. Indeede if our ſaluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended vpon any merits of ours, as the Papiſts ſay, then it were much materiall, what manner of perſons wee were. But <hi>according to his mercie he ſaueth vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, without reſpect of any thing in vs whatſoeuer. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, this is true alſo euen after their conuerſion, when as many times they fall into ſuch foule and enormous ſinnes, that for the preſent, their outward conuerſation is as bad, as if they were reprobates. And this appeareth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this example of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe of it. It was not the qualitie of <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſinne, that made it worſe then <hi>Peters,</hi> but his graceleſneſſe, that could not repent of it, as <hi>Peter</hi> did.

For firſt, he committeth adulterie with <hi>Vriah</hi> his wife: after that, hee vſeth very vile and ſinfull ſhifts to ſaue his credit, and to couer his ſinne.

When he could not perſwade him to goe home, hee cauſeth him to eat at his owne table, and there maketh him drunke, thinking that then hee would haue done it.

So the child of God, both in his own feeling, and in the iudgment of others, may ſeeme to be graceleſſe, and yet there is grace remaining in the heart, though ſo weake, as it can hardly be diſcerned. For as fire is often ſo raked vp vnder the aſhes, as that there is no token of fire to be ſeene, there is neither light, nor heat, nor ſo much as any ſmoake; and yet there is fire which with blowing, and ſupply of newe fewell, will ſoone kindle againe: As trees in winter ſeeme to bee dead and withered, but yet there is ſappe belowe in the roote, which in the ſpring will appeare, and cauſe them to bud and flouriſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: And as the ſunne may for a time be hid from our ſight by ſome thicke cloud, and yet when the cloud is diſperſed, it appeareth againe in perfit beauty. So the graces of Gods ſpirit may ſeeme for a time to bee in a manner dead and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in vs: but in the end, they haue their liuely and powerfull operation as before. A woman that is with quicke child, may for a ſpace neuer feele it ſtirre within her: yet ſhe is not diſcouraged, but afterwads ſhe feeleth it againe. So

peraduenture, the child of God may for a certaine ſeaſon, feele no ſtirring nor mouing of Gods grace within him: but yet herein he may ſtay himſelfe, that if euer he felt it in truth, hee ſhall in good time feele it againe to his comfort. And in this reſpect our eſtate is farre better then was the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> euen in his innocency; God had indued him with an excellent meaſure of grace, but being all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his owne keeping, the Deuill ſoone ſpoiled him of it.

Now to the end, that wee may not abuſe theſe examples of Gods children, to the incouraging of our ſelues in ſinne: let vs conſider firſt, that this was no ordinarie thing with them, to fall in this manner. It is teſtified of <hi>Dauid,</hi> euen by the Lord himſelfe, that <hi>hee did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord all the dayes of his life, ſaue onely in the matter of</hi> Vriah. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Dauid</hi> then made no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of ſinning. So wee doe not reade, that euer <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt Ieſus any more, no hee was moſt conſtant in confeſſing of his name, euen vnto death. Neither doe wee reade that <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Lot</hi> were euer ouertaken with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againe. And therefore the examples of their falles can bee no incouragement to them that continually adde ſinne to ſinne; making whoredome and drunkenneſſe, and ſuch like horrible ſinnes, their ordinarie trade and common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. Theſe men ſinned indeede, but it was of infirmitie, through the violence of temptation: and they did not lie along in their ſinne, but renued their repentance with griefe of heart; and therefore God receiued them to mercy, and forgaue them their ſinnes. But this is nothing to thee, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, that ſinneſt preſumptuouſly with an high band, and liueſt and lyeſt in thy ſinne impenitently. God hath no mercy for thee, ſo long as thou continueſt in this eſtate.</p>
            <p>Againe for our ſelues, let vs conſider what hurt wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, whenſoeuer wee fall into any ſinne. For firſt of all, that ſpirituall comfort and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, which once wee felt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</note> and which before was in vs <hi>vnspeakeable and glorious,</hi> vaniſheth away, and our ſoules are filled with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, by reaſon of Gods diſpleaſure, and the conſcience is made euen the picture of hell.

ſaith, <hi>Make me to heare of ioy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may reioyce.</hi> Inſinuating, that the the horrour of conſcience, that followeth vpon the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſinnes, is like the breaking of a mans bones, which is the greateſt paine that can be.

               <hi>Out of the deepe places, haue I called vnto thee, O Lord:</hi> as though for the time hee had beene in the bottome of hell. Secondly, wee are made vnfit to any thing that is good: ſo that till we be reſtored againe by repentance, wee are made vnprofitable burdens of the earth. There is no cheerefulneſſe in Prayer, no life in hearing the word, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in receiuing the Lords ſupper.

Thirdly, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, we are made moſt apt and ready to runne into any ſinne. Whiles we lie impenitent in any tranſgreſſion, the deuill cannot offer a tentation to vs, but wee are ready to yeeld, as may appeare in this example of <hi>Peter,</hi> as wee ſhall ſee afterward. Fourthly, we are ſure to ſmart for it, for God will correct vs with one rod or other, till we bee throughly humbled, as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Dauid: If thy children forſake my Law,</hi>

And therefore, to conclude in all theſe reſpects, wee ſhould bee carefull by all holy meanes to preſerue our ſelues from ſinne, and not preſume, becauſe God hath beene mercifull in forgiuing many great and grieuous ſinners.</p>

It is an eaſie matter to profeſſe the Goſpell, while all is quiet, and the weather faire; but all the triall of conſtancie is in aduerſitie. The valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of a Souldier is beſt ſeene in the hotteſt ſkirmiſh; the ſkill of a Marriner is beſt diſcerned in the greateſt tempeſt; So the conſtancie of a Chriſtian is beſt tryed in the moſt greiuous perſecution: when a tree hath taken deepe root, it endureth the violence of winde and weather: when a houſe is builded on a ſure foundation, neither raine, nor flood, nor raging ſtormes can make it fall. So it is a good token that a man is rooted and grounded in the truth, when hee ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not for euery blaſt of winde. As the ſhadow followeth the body ſo long as the Sunne ſhineth, but when it is clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it vaniſheth away: ſo in time of proſperitie all men will bee followers of Chriſt: but aſſoone as <hi>perſecution or tribulation commeth for Chriſts ſake, they are gone.</hi> As our Sauiour ſaith; Many with the Sonnes of <hi>Zebedee would bee Chriſts Diſciples,</hi> if he had an earthly Kingdome, to aduance them to places of honour, that one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left hand. But when it comes to this reckoning, that they muſt pledge him of that bitter cup of the Croſſe, that hee drunke of before them, then I feare me, they would be ready to ſay with the carnall <hi>Capernaites;</hi> This is <hi>an hard ſaying, who can beare it?</hi> Like the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> that would faine goe to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they are loath to bee ſo long toſſed vp and downe in the wilderneſſe.

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21.</note> As our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his Pallace, the things hee poſſeſſeth are in peace.</hi> So long as the Deuill hath peaceable poſſeſſion of a mans heart, ſo long he neuer moleſteth him: hee willingly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Deuill and delighteth in his ſeruice, and therefore what neede the Deuill oppugne him. A King neuer lifteth vp his ſword againſt his owne loyall ſubiects, but if once they begin to rebell, then hee rayſeth a power to ſubdue them to his obedience. In like manner, ſo long as men are ſworne ſubiects to the Deuill, he neuer ſtirreth againſt them: but if once, by the grace of God, they begin to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to ſhake off his yoake, then hee rageth and laboureth by all meanes poſſible to reduce them into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.

Indeed that they cannot indure at any hand, oh no they ſpit at the very name of him, and crie out vpon him foule feind &amp;c. but for his temptations they make no matter at all of them. But poore ſoules, they are much deceiued. For the Deuill is alwayes preſent in all places, though they ſee him not. And his temptations are farre more fearefull then his apparitions. For theſe are not ſo terrible to the eye, as they are to the ſoule.</p>

There is ſuch a combination of ſinne, that as in the linkes of a chaine, if a man draw one, all the reſt follow; ſo if a man grant a little ſinne, a greater will come after. And in this reſpect, the diſeaſes of the ſoule are farre worſe then thoſe of the body. For they that are troubled with the ſtone,<note place="margin">Eraſ. de lingua.</note> are commonly free from other maladies. But there is no diſeaſe of the ſoule, but it bringeth with it a troope of vices.

And as this is true in the wicked, ſo likewiſe euen the children of God, when they giue way to one ſinne, vnleſſe the Lord in mercy by his grace reſtraine them, they fall further to the wounding of their conſciences, and the endangering of their ſoules, as appeareth in the examples of <hi>Noah, Lot, Dauid,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others, whereof we haue ſpoken before.

It is a rule in <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> that no clement is heauy ſo long as it is in his owne ſphere. As for example, let a man that is skillfull in ſwimming, diue into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea, ſo long as he is vnder the water, he feeleth no waight, though a mountaine, as it were, of water lie vpon his backe, becauſe the water is in his proper place.

In like manner, ſo long as ſinne is familiar to a man, that his heart is, as it were, the proper ſeat of it, hee neuer feeleth any waight of it, though it bee ready to preſſe and ſinke him downe to hell, yet he goeth away with it, as if it were as light as a feather.

            <p>And this the Apoſtle confeſſeth, where ſpeaking of his great paines in Preaching the word, namely that <hi>he laboured more abundantly then all the reſt</hi> of his fellowes, hee ſtraight way correcteth himſelfe as if hee had arrogated more then became him, <hi>Yet not I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but the grace of God which is with me,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.

And to this inward voyce muſt you lift vp the eares of your ſoules, and deſire rather to heare God ſpeaking inwardly, then man ſpeaking outwardly. The neglect of this dutie is the cauſe, why the word is ſo ineffectuall in many places, as it is. For firſt, many of vs that be Miniſters, come to preach our ſelues, and not Chriſt Ieſus: and to vent our owne gifts, and let them take winde, and not to ſeeke the ſaluation of our hearers; and therefore, God denyeth to worke by our Miniſterie.

But what did <hi>Peter</hi> in the meane while? did hee any whit further or helpe forward himſelfe to repentance? Surely he did as much as lay in him to further himſelfe to hell. For as wee haue heard, hee was ſwearing and curſing himſele in moſt horrible manner that he neuer knew Chriſt. But after that he was outwardly rowſed by the crowing of the cocke, and inwardly awaked by Chriſts looking backe vpon him, then hee began to conſider the danger of that eſtate wherein he ſtood.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> This doctrine ſerueth firſt to refell a maine point of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery concerning freewill. The Papiſts doe ſtiffely maintain that there is in mans will a naturall power to that which is truely good, whereby of it ſelfe it cooperateth with Gods grace in the firſt act of mans conuerſion. They ſay that God onely firſt perſwadeth the will, as a man may perſwade his friend to take a iourney, whereto he is vnwilling. But in the accompliſhing of any worke, God is onely an aſſiſtant, and man by his owne power worketh together with him. But this is iniurious to match the doing of man with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. Indeed man hath no power ouer the heart, but draweth onely by perſwaſion: but the Lord by his diuine power, doth not onely perſwade, but alſo bendeth and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the heart as it pleaſeth him. And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in that excellent prayer of his deſireth the Lord, <hi>to bow their hearts vnto him, that they may walke in his waies, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.58. So that it is blaſphemous to hold, that the wil of man ſhould worke with Gods grace in any thing that is good. Indeed as they are works and actions, ſo they proceed from the will of man: but as they are good workes, they are onely the works of grace, as our Sauiour Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>without mee ye can doe nothing.

But to the ende that the truth heereof may better appeare, wee muſt diſtinguiſh the actions of man into three ſorts. Some actions of men are naturall, namelie ſuch as are common to him with other creatures, as to eate, drinke, walke, ſleepe, and ſuch like. In all which it is true that man hath freedome of will: but yet ſo, as he is not able to doe any of theſe things, to any good or godly end. Yea, though mens thoughts be free, yet their actions are not free. It is not as free for a man to doe or not doe, as it is to will or not to will. And therefore, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe, neither is it in man to walke and direct his ſteppes.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20836:68"/>

For a man cannot ſo eaſily come out of a pit, as hee may fall into it. Man by his will alone fell into the pit of ſinne; but his will is not ſufficient to make him able to riſe againe. And <hi>S.

Neither doth he teach vs what we are able to performe, but what himſelfe may iuſtly exact of vs. And wee are bound to doe them, though wee bee neuer ſo vnable.

And yet neuertheleſſe, man in all his euill actions muſt needes be culpable. For it will not follow from hence that the will of man is any way forced or compelled, but that it doth willingly and of the one accord deſire whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it will. For God ruleth and gouerneth the will of man according to the nature of it, and no otherwiſe. Now the nature of the will is to will whatſoeuer it luſteth, whether it be good or euill, freely and willingly, not by conſtraint or againſt the will: for otherwiſe it were no will, but a nilling tather. So that Gods foreknowledge is no cauſe at all of the euill actions of men. And this <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by an apt ſimilitude.<note place="margin">Pet. Martyr.

As therefore that neceſſitie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20836:72"/>
doth not infringe the nature of their will: ſo likewiſe the foreknowledge &amp; decree of God doth not compel the will of man. But it will be obiected; why doth not God ouer-rule the will of man, ſeeing he is able, and hinder him from falling into ſinne? I anſwere, that man indeed, who is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, if hee ſhould not hinder euill from his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when it lyeth in his power, ſhould be blame-worthy: as our Sauiour ſaith:<note place="margin">

Yea hee, doth it alwayes to a good end. For hee knoweth, that man being by nature euill cannot but ſinne, vnleſſe hee be preuented by the eſpeciall aſſiſtance of his grace; and that he cannot but fall vnleſſe the ſtaffe of his ſpirit doe ſupport him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. and yet in great wiſedome he ſuffereth him to fall, partly to declare his iuſtice in puniſhing of ſinne,<note place="margin">Gualt in Zech.

               </note> partly, to manifeſt his mercy in pardoning ſinne, and partly, to ſhew man his frailty and weakneſſe, that he may be more heedfull for the time to come. Thus God directeth the ſins of the godly and the wicked to a good end, that the one may become more wary afterwardes, and the other beſides their meaning and intent may execute the iudgements of God. Thus was <hi>Dauid</hi> by his adultery made more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, thus was <hi>Peter</hi> by his deniall made more ſtout in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of Chriſt, and thus was <hi>Paul</hi> by his cruell perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made more feruent and earneſt in preaching of the truth.<note n="a" place="margin">Deus ſicut bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum optimus creator eſt; ita malarum volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum iuſtiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ordinator. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t cum malè illae vtuntur na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis bonis, ipſe bene vtatur eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am voluntatibus malis. de Ciu.

It is as eaſy for the <hi>Blacke Moore to change his skinne,</hi> and for the <hi>Leopard to change his ſpottes,</hi> as for a man to <hi>forſake an old ſinne. Ierem.</hi> 13.23. And hence it is, that young men by continuance and long cuſtome, make their ſinnes of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dye, euen <hi>crimſon ſinnes,</hi> as the Prophet ſaith. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. Yea they are like a diſeaſe in the bones, whereof if one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, many doe rot away. And partly, becauſe as ſinne ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth ſtrength: ſo we in our old age become weaker in all the faculties and powers of body and ſoule, and therefore farre vnfit for the great worke of repentance in mortifying and ſubduing our ſinnes. It is reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> that great Conquerour, that when his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to forbeare the warres till hee were growne to a full and perfect age: he anſwered in this manner. I feare leaſt if I tarry till I come to that age, I ſhall looſe the heat and vigour of my youth. So may we anſwere al tentations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, whereby wee ſhall bee perſwaded to deferre our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance till wee bee olde. And indeede olde age is a burden and a ſickneſſe it ſelfe,<note n="c" place="margin">Senectus ipſa eſt morbus. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Phor. Diog. Laert. in vita Dionis.</note> and therefore altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to vndergoe ſo great a taske as this is. Yea the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher called it the Hauen of all euill, becauſe innumerable maladies, and cramps and aches, and ſickneſſes doe flocke thither, as into a common receptacle. And this doth <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai</hi> confeſſe to <hi>Dauid. I am this day</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>foureſcore yeere old, and can I diſcerne betweene good or euill?

               <hi>Can I heare any more the voice of ſinging men and women? Wherefore then ſhould thy ſeruant be any more a burden vnto my Lord the King?</hi> Hee confeſſeth, that his age had ſo decayed all the powers of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20836:79"/>
and ſoule, as that he was vtterly diſabled from attending on the King. Much more ſhall a man bee diſabled from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the worke of grace. And hence it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth the daies of old age,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1.</note> euill daies. <hi>Remember now</hi> ſaith he, <hi>tby creator in the daies of thy youth, before the euill daies come.</hi> Not becauſe they are euill in themſelues, but becauſe of the manifold miſeries that doe accompany them. So that if a man ſhall be careleſſe in his youth, and thinke when hee is old to doe great matters, to frequent the Church &amp; heare the word &amp;c. He may peraduenture be deceiued. For many times we ſee <hi>the ſtrong men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

And therefore as all men would condemne him for a foole, that hauing a great burden to bee carried, would lay it on the backe of a poore weake beaſt, that hath enough to do to beare vp it ſelfe, and let a ſtronger go emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: So likewiſe is it great folly in any man to exempt his youth which is ſtrong and luſty, from the task of repentance and to impoſe the ſame vpon his decrepit old age, which is ready to ſinke vnder the owne burden<note n="a" place="margin">Eſto, multa tibi annorum curricular eſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, adoleſcens es v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<expan>

The daies of ſaluation paſſe away and no man regardeth it, no man conſidereth that his time which will neuer returne

Againe, it is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury vnto the Lord that can be, for a man to conſecrate the prime daies of his youth to the ſeruice of the Deuill, in the purſuit of ſinfull pleaſures, and the dogge daies of his olde age to the Lord.

               </note> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> being asked what hee thought of ſuch a man, made this anſwere: I do not ſay he is ſaued, nor I do not ſay hee is damned. But I would aduiſe thee to repent while thou art in health. The reaſon is, firſt becauſe if a man doe not repent till hee be weakned and diſabled with ſickneſſe, his ſinnes forſake him, he forſaketh not them. What thanks is it for a drunkard to giue ouer drunkennes, when he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go any longer to the Alehouſe? or for the whorema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to leaue his whoredome, when he hath no ſtrength for the performance and execution of his filthy deſires? A man ſhould willingly of himſelfe part with his ſinnes euen while he is able to commit them, &amp; not by conſtraint, when there is no remedy. Secondly, there is great danger that death ſhould preuent him before this time. For doe we not ſee many taken away on the ſodaine, before euer they look or prepare for it? <hi>They ſpend their daies in wealth, and ſuddenly they goe downe the graue,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith: <hi>and are cropt off as an eare of corne.</hi> Haue wee not examples euery day almoſt of ſome that go well to bed at night, and are ſound dead in the morning? and of others that droppe downe by the high

way ſide, and dye in the field? As the candle burneth bright for a time, but if one blaſt of wind come ouer it, it is put out, and there remaineth nothing but a ſtinking ſnuffe: ſo many a man flouriſheth for a while, but in a moment God taketh away his breath, and there remaineth nothing but a filthy ſtinke of his ſinnes, whereof hee had not repented. Wee may not take vpon vs to determine peremptorily of ſuch,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.</note> becauſe <hi>the iudgements of God are vnſearchable, and his waies paſt finding out.</hi> But yet the caſe is fearefull, and that which befalleth one may befall another. Death is fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an Archer: For as the Archer ſomtimes ſhooteth ouer, and ſometimes ſhort, ſometimes on the one hand and ſometimes on the other, but at laſt he hitteth the marke. In like manner, death ſometimes ſhooteth ouer thee, and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thy ſuperiours, ſometimes hee ſhooteth ſhort and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thy inferiors: ſometimes he ſhooteth on thy right hand and taketh away thy friends, ſomtimes on thy left hand, and killeth thy enemies,<note place="margin">Ariſt. problem. loc. <hi>34.</hi> Omnem crede diem tibi dilux iſſe ſupremum: Grata ſuperue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet quae non ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabitur, hora.

               </note> but at the laſt he wil hitte thy ſelfe: thou knoweſt not how ſoone. And therefore, it was good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Iew gaue to one that asked his aduiſe in this caſe.

            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that this doe not befall them, but that they dye an ordinary death; yet for the moſt part there are ſo many hinderances in ſickneſſe,<note place="margin">Quoniam multa ſunt quae impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt &amp; languen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem retrahant: periculoſiſſimum eſt, &amp; interitui vicinum, ad mortem protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here remedium.

               </note> If the Lord would haue had part of our ſinnes reſerued, he might haue done much good to the poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had ſeauen Deuils, to haue caſt out ſixe and left but one. But hee caſt out ſeauen; to teach vs, that all our ſinnes muſt be abandoned. And when he caſt forth a legion out of another hee left not one of them all to poſſeſſe the partie: ſtil giuing vs to vnderſtand, that if a man haue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſinnes, hee muſt repent of them all. Whatſoeuer ſinne it is that a man liueth in, though it bee neuer ſo ſweete and pleaſant, though neuer ſo profitable and gainefull, though of neuer ſo long continuance, hee muſt auoide it. VVhen God ſent <hi>Saul</hi> in expedition againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> hee gaue him a ſtrait charge, that he ſhould deſtroy all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto them, and that he ſhould <hi>haue no compaſsion on them, but ſlay both man and woman, both infant and ſuckling, both oxe and ſheepe, both camell and aſſe.</hi> So when we begin to ſubdue our ſinnes, thoſe curſed <hi>Amalekites,</hi> which fight againſt our ſoules, wee muſt ſpare none, how deare ſoeuer, but put them all to the ſword, both ſmall and great. <hi>VVee muſt mortifie all our earthly members, and caſt away all things whatſoeuer are diſpleaſing vnto God.</hi> In the time of the law, the Lord commaunded the <hi>Leper,</hi> that when he was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he muſt <hi>ſhaue off all his haire.</hi> Hee muſt not ſuffer one old haire to grow, for feare of infection. In like manner, a man that ſetteth himſelfe ſeriouſly to repent, hee muſt not retaine any one of his former ſinnes. As <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, that they that are truely godly,<note place="margin">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> godly ſorrow for our ſinnes. As wee doe euery day renue our ſinnes, ſo muſt wee euery day recure our ſorrow for them. And the rather, firſt becauſe the hainouſneſſe of our ſinnes doth require it. Sinne if a man had grace to diſcerne it, is the heauieſt and the waightieſt burden of the world. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a ſtone is heauie,</hi>

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13.</note> that made the poore <hi>Publicane</hi> expreſſe ſuch tokens of griefe and ſhame for his ſinnes, when hee durſt <hi>not lift vp ſo much as his eies to heauen, but ſmote his breaſt, ſaying: O God be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi>

               </note> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, if a man ſhall conſider the quality of his ſinne, and aggrauate it by the circumſtances of time and place, and by his continuance in it, and ſhall call to mind, vpon how light temptation he was brought to commit it, and how oft hee hath iterated the ſame, he cannot chooſe but euen groane in godly ſorrow vnder the burden thereof.<note n="a" place="margin">Non laborat exonerari pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, cui non vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nimium.

Hee that ſhall thinke his time to be as light as a feather, and neuer ſeeth any hurt that commeth by it, no maruell if it neuer grieue him. Secondly, without ſorrow for ſinne there can bee no true repentance. It is in vaine for men to ſay, they repent
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20836:89"/>
euery day they riſe, and yet neuer ſhew any token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe. It may bee vpon ſome occaſion they may ceaſe the committing of ſinne, but till their hearts bee broken with ſorrow;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.28. &amp; 42.21.</note> they neuer repent of it. <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren had left their cruelty towards their brother for many yeares, yet they neuer repented of it indeede, till by his rough handling of them in Egypt, they were brought to the ſight of their ſinne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. &amp; 12</note> and touched with ſorrow for the ſame. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> though hee had giuen ouer his adultery, yet hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer repented of it, before <hi>Nathan</hi> awaked him by denouncing the iudgement of God againſt him. Yea ſuch as are deſtitute of godly ſorrow, are ſo farre from repenting of their ſinnes, that whenſoeuer any occaſion is offered, they are ready to fall into them againe, though in ſome carnall reſpect for a time they haue forborne them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, without this ſorrow there can be no ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: we muſt neuer looke to feele comfort in the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, vnleſſe withall we haue our hearts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with ſorrow for committing of them. The Lord will not impart the leaſt droppe of his mercy to any, which haue not firſt beene baptized with the baptiſme of their owne teares. There were neuer any of Gods children throughly comforted, but they were firſt humbled. For God is not like a fooliſh Phiſitian, that will apply a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, where there is no diſeaſe: nor like a fooliſh Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, that will lay a plaiſter, where there is no ſore. But the conſcience muſt firſt be wounded with a ſenſe of ſinne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1.</note> before the Lord will powre in the Oile of his mercy, to heale the ſame.<note place="margin">

As there is no ſinne ſo great but by repentance and godly ſorrow it is pardonable: ſo there is no ſinne ſo little, but without repentance it is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.<note n="y" place="margin">Aut continui dolores crucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt poenitentem vitam meam, aut cruciatus ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terni vexabunt puniendam am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam meam.

            <p>Laſt of all, this godly ſorrow for ſinne is moſt pleaſing and acceptable vnto God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a contrite ſpirit; a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despiſe.</hi> Whereupon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <note n="z" place="margin">Intucamur que madmodum vbi Deum dixit nolle ſacrificium ibidem Deum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendit velle ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium.

               </note> Let vs conſider in what ſenſe: where he hath ſaid that God will haue no ſacrifice, in the ſame place hee ſheweth that God will haue ſacrifice. He will not then haue the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a ſlaughtered beaſt, but hee will haue the ſacrifice of a contrite heart. And indeede, this is the chiefeſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of all other. And therefore the Lord hath promiſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to haue reſpect to him, <hi>that is of a contrite heart.</hi> Yea the Lord taketh ſuch pleaſure in a man thus affected, as there is neuer a teare falleth from his eies in remorſe for his ſinnes, but preſently <hi>hee putteth them in his bottle,</hi> and at the day of iudgement <hi>he will wipe all teares from the eies</hi> of his children.

               </note> For a man to haue his ſinnes before his eyes, and not to grieue for them; to ſee ſhamefull thinges and not to be aſhamed; to behold lamentable things and not to ſorrow; is a ſigne of death, and a token of damnation. For the member that hath no feeling is dead, and the diſeaſe that is inſenſible, is paſt cure. Many doe glorie and boaſt, that they neuer felt any thing yet that came neare their hearts. But this, if they could ſee it, is a worſe ſigne vnto them, and more prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then if a blaſing ſtarre hanged ouer their heads, or if an Angel from heauen ſhould pronounce them to be accurſed. <note n="f" place="margin">Ira Dei eſt non intelligere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, vt ſequatur paenitentia.

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14.</note> Yea ſaith <hi>Samuel,</hi> haſt thou ſo? <hi>What meaneth then the bleating of the ſheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?</hi> So a man may heare the bleating of many oathes, and the lowing of many curſed ſpeeches euen from them that would ſeeme to bee moſt reformed.

            <p>And thus wee haue heard the repentance of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> and as in his fall wee haue ſeene the Image of a grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinner, ſo in this wee haue ſeene the picture of a true Conuert. Many will fall with <hi>Peter</hi> and other of Gods children, but they will not riſe with them by repentance. Theſe men deceiue themſelues: ſuch examples as this will doe them no good. Thou ſeeſt that <hi>Peter</hi> was as ready to

            <p>Now howſoeuer there be not any plaine ſtory of <hi>Peters</hi> repentance, either in the Goſpels, or in the Acts, beſides this mention of his; teares yet it is moſt certaine, that hee did truely and vnfainedly repent. Our Sauiour aſſured him of it before his fall, when hee ſaid: <hi>I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not and when thou art conuerted ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy brethren.

And wee haue experience of many, that only in hope of gaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the religion, which they ſeemed to profeſſe, and become Papiſts.

there is euen in nature a diſpoſition, neuer to waigh the iſſue of a thing throughly, till it be done and paſt. Which being furthered by the Deuill, muſt needes be ſo much the worſe. Hence was it, that <hi>Iudas</hi> neuer ſaw the hainouſneſſe of his bloudy thoughts againſt his Maſter, till he was condemned; otherwiſe he would neuer haue done ſo cruell a deede. He had often heard from our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, that hee muſt be betrayed, and deliuered into the hands of the high Prieſts, and by them be crucified.

No doubt, he made him beleeue, that Chriſt ſhould neuer be put to death; but that hee might enrich himſelfe with the money, and yet his Maſter ſhould do well enough. He perſwaded him, that either his owne innocencie would acquite him, when he ſhould be brought to his trial; or elſe, if his enemies ſhould be ſo malicious, as to condemne him without cauſe, yet by his diuine power, he could eaſily when he liſted,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.6.</note> hee did but ſpeake a word, and <hi>they all went backward, and fell to the ground.</hi> But now, perceiuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his opinion, that hee was condemned to death, at the laſt he acknowledgeth the grieuouſnes of his ſinne, and is touched with remorſe. As the Deuill dealt with <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſo hee dealeth with all ſinners: hee leadeth them long hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckt through many ſinnes, and at the laſt, when their eies are opened, that they ſee the odiouſneſſe of their ſinnes, but

               <hi>I haue ſinned.]</hi> This is the ſecond part of <hi>Iudas</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, namely his confeſſion: which though it bee ſet downe after his reſtitution, yet no doubt it was in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. And therefore we will handle it firſt. And firſt wee will ſpeake of it in generall, and then more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter of it. In this confeſſion of his, wee ſee hee goeth very farre. Firſt he confeſſeth his ſin openly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, without any regard of his credit, he careth not who heareth him. Secondly, he doth not onely confeſſe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tearmes, <hi>I haue ſinned,</hi> but hee layeth out his particular ſin, <hi>I haue ſinned,</hi> ſairh he, <hi>in betraying innocent bloud.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he went a great deale farther then many will doe at this day: and yet hee went not farre enough. For many things were wanting in him which are required in true confeſſion: which that it may the better appeare, let vs conſider the doctrine of true confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Wherein we are to obſerue, firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> The nature of true confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the perſon to whom we muſt confeſſe our ſinnes: and ſecondly, the manner how we muſt confeſſe them. For the perſon, wee are to know, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20836:108"/>
firſt and ptincipally we muſt confeſſe our ſinnes to God: as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>I acknowledged</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my ſinne vnto thee: for I thought, I will confeſſe my wickedneſſe vnto the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 32.5. And the reaſon is. Firſt, becauſe all ſinne is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God; as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee onely haue I ſinned, and done euill in thy ſight.</hi> It is true, we may and doe wrong and hurt men by our ſinnes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> highly iniured <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> by his ſinne, but as it is a ſinne, the cheifeſt diſhonour is againſt God. And ſo was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> perſwaded, when hee would not yeeld to the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Miſtris. <hi>How can I doe this great wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt God Gen.</hi> 39.9. And yet withall he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the ſame place, that it would haue beene a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt his Maſter, conſidering what truſt he had repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him<note n="a" place="margin">Solus Deus miſereri poteſt: veniam peccatis quae in ipſum commiſſa ſunt, ſolus poteſt ille largiri, qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata noſtra por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauit.

               </note> Seondly, becauſe God onely can forgiue ſinne. The <hi>Scribes and Phariſes,</hi> though they were corrupt in many things, yet in this they held the truth, when they ſaid <hi>Who can forgiue ſiinnes but God onely?</hi> And <hi>Elihu</hi> in the book of <hi>Iob</hi> affirmeth it very confidently <hi>Surely,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth vnto God to ſay, I haue pardoned, I will not deſtroy.</hi> And the Lord himſelfe teſtifieth as much ſaying, <hi>I euen I am hee that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne ſake &amp;c.</hi> So that it is euident, that our ſins muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eſſed vnto God. Now here <hi>Iudas</hi> failed. For no doubt if hee had vnfainedly confeſſed his ſinnes to the Lord, hee had obtained the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them according to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Iohn: If wee confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue vs our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt confeſſe our ſinnes alſo to men, and that both publikely and priuatly, as the qualitie of the ſinne requireth. For publike confeſſion, if a mans ſinne haue been publike to the offence and ſcandall of the Church, and hee hath beene excommunicate for it, he ought publikely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame, and earneſtly deſire to be receiued into the felloſhip of the Church againe.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> Thus was that inceſtuous perſon, that was deliuered to <hi>Sathan</hi> for his ſinne, vpon his humiliation reſtored. And indeede, there is a very neceſſary vſe of this open confeſſion: firſt, in reſpect of God, who is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20836:108"/>
thereby much glorified, as before he had been diſhonored. And therefore, when <hi>Ioſhua</hi> laboured to bring <hi>Achan</hi> to a free and heartie confeſsion of his ſinne he ſaith. <hi>My ſonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7.10.</note> 
               <hi>I beſeech thee, giue glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, and make confeſsion vnto him, &amp; ſhew me now what thou haſt done, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, in reſpect of the Church, both that the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that hath beene offended, may be ſatisfied, when it ſeeth the ſinner conuerted: and alſo that others may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified from committing the like ſinnes, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Them that ſinne rebuke openly, that the reſt may feare.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20.</note> And laſt of all, in reſpect of the ſinner himſelf, that he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be the more humbled, as the inceſtuous perſon was,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of. Whereas otherwiſe, if it be made a money matter, few or none will regard it. <hi>Dauid</hi> performed this of his owne accord. When he had diſhonoured God, and ſcandalized the Church by his grieuous ſins, and had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>enemies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> he penned the 51. <hi>pſalm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14.</note> to teſtifie his repentance to God and the world, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the Church to all poſterity.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6.</note> And <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none to his baptiſme, but ſuch as firſt made humble confeſsion of their ſinnes. And the coniurers being brought to true repentance, came into the Church, and <hi>confeſſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 19.18.</note> 
               <hi>and ſhewed their workes.</hi> And thus was it alwaies in the ancient Church, where all notorious offenders were exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, and debarred from publike praiers, and the vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. They remained apart in the Church, and heard Sermons, that thereby they might the better be brought to the ſight of their ſins. And after a certaine time, they were admitted to praiers, but yet in a ſeate by themſelues, called the ſeate of the penitents (as they ſay, it is the vſe at this day in <hi>Scotland.</hi>) But when the Sacraments began to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, they departed. At the laſt, being throughly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, with bitter teares they craued pardon of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which they had offended, and ſo were reſtored and receiued againe.<note n="a" place="margin">Tripart. hiſt. lib. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>
               </note> And this diſcipline did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe againſt <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor, who hauing made a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> was kept out of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20836:109"/>
Church for the ſpace of eight Moneths, and after being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he did not ſtand, nor bow his knees only, but fell flat on his face vpon the floore, and tearing off his haire with his hands, and bedewing the pauement with his teares, hee deſired that his ſin might be forgiuen.<note n="b" place="margin">Amplector prompta &amp; ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na dilectione, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poenitetia reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes, peccatum ſuum ſatisfactio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne humili &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plici conſitentes.

               </note> And this was the practiſe of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as himſelfe teſtifieth. I doe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaith he, and louingly, embrace ſuch as returne penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and confeſſe their ſinnes, with humble and vnfained ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. But if there be any that thinke they may come againe to the Church, not by intreaty, but by threatnings, or ſuppoſe to procure their admittance, not by lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſatisfactions, but by terrours; let them know for a certainty, that the Church of God ſtandeth out againſt ſuch perſons; and that the inuincible and ſtrong tents of Chriſt, guarded by the Lords protection, will not giue place to threatnings. The Prieſt of God, that holdeth the Goſpell, and keepeth the precepts of Chriſt, may bee killed, but hee cannot be ouercome. And this was the reſolution of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> when he heard that the Emperour was comming towards the Church, before he was abſolued.<note n="c" place="margin">Ego vero prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico, quod cum ingredi ſacra li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina prohibebo: ſi vero Imperium in tyrannidem mutabit, necem libenter ſuſcipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.

               </note> he that hath offended many by ſinning, ought to pacifie many by making ſatisfaction; that as the Church hath before beene offended by the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, ſo by the repentance it may be moued to compaſſion. And indeed he that is truly touched with a ſenſe and feeling of his ſinnes, will not be tender of his owne credit, nay hee will not care how much he diſgraceth himſelfe, ſo that by his confeſſion he may glorifie God, and edifie the Church. And therefore, they may iuſtly ſuſpect their repentance, that hauing publikely offended, cannot be brought to make publike confeſſion. And as this publike confeſsion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, ſo in priuate offences, priuate confeſsion is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Firſt, in reſpect of our ſelues, that by emptying our
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20836:109"/>
hearts into the boſome of another, wee may receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And this is that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> exhorteth, ſaying:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>Acknowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that yee may be healed.</hi> But here we are to know, that a man is not bound to confeſſe his ſinnes only to the Miniſter, and to none elſe (as the Papiſts teach men to lay open their ſinnes to a greaſie bald Frier) but he may make choiſe of any other Chriſtian friend, of whoſe godlineſſe and faithfulneſſe he hath good experience.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.</note> Neither is a man bound to make confeſsion of all his ſinnes, as the Papiſts would haue it, (for <hi>who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi>) but only of ſuch as doe moſt afflict his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Secondly, in reſpect of others: And firſt of ſuch as we haue offended by our ſinnes, according to the rule of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23.24. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, Leaue there thine offering before the Altar, and goe thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, &amp;c.</hi> Now here <hi>Iudas</hi> failed, in that hee goeth to the high Prieſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to them, but doth not proſtrate himſelfe before his Maſter, whom he had betrayed, and deſire him to forgiue him his ſinne: which if he had done,<note n="a" place="margin">Arbitror quod etiam <hi>Iudas</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuiſſet tanta Dei miſeratione non excludi à venia, ſi poenitentiam non apud ludae or ſed apud Chriſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> egiſſet. Ambroſ. de poenit. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> ſo great is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to poore ſinners, he might haue obtayned pardon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of ſuch as to whom wee haue giuen occaſion of ſinne, or haue beene any meanes to draw them to ſinne. And in this <hi>Iudas</hi> did well. For in going to the high Prieſts, he doth not only confeſſe his owne ſinne, but withall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them occaſion to repent likewiſe. For if he ſinned in betraying Chriſt Ieſus, ſurely they alſo ſinned in apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, condemning, and putting him to death. And thus we ſee the perſons, to whom we are to make confeſsion of our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Now for the manner, we are to know, that euery kinde of confeſsion will not ſerue the turne. And therefore, theſe properties are required. Firſt, it is not enough to confeſſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20836:110"/>
our ſinnes in generall, as ignorant men vſe to thump them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the breaſt, and ſay, I am a ſinner, but we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our particular ſinnes. If any man ſhall obiect, that this is needleſſe, becauſe God knoweth our ſinnes better then we our ſelues doe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh</hi> 3.20.</note> for <hi>he is greater then our hearts, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things.</hi> I anſwere, that it is true indeede, all our ſins are moſt perfitly knowne to the Lord.<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Who is accuſtomed to all our waies,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith. And therefore, wee doe not confeſſe our ſinnes to informe God, but wee doe it for our owne benefit, that thereby we may be brought vnto godly ſorrow, which is attained by a diſtinct acknowledgement of our ſinnes. And thus haue the children of God confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſinnes. When <hi>Dauid</hi> had numbred his people, and his heart did ſmite him for it, he confeſſed particularly, <hi>I haue ſinned exceedingly in that I haue done.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</note> And in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the 51 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> hee confeſſeth his adultery in plaine termes. And ſo doth the Apoſtle confeſſe how he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 22.19 20.</note> yea by name, how he had been a great ſtickler in the Martyrdome of bleſſed <hi>Steuen.</hi> Yea <hi>Iudas</hi> in this place performed this duty. And ſurely, if it were not neceſſary, the Deuill would neuer labour to hinder it ſo much as he doth (as wee ſee how hard it is to bring one of an hundred to doe it as they ought) for he knoweth, that if once men come to a true ſight of their particular ſinnes, and ſo to godly ſorrow, his Kingdome will ſoone decay, and therefore, he maketh men ſo vnwilling to yeeld to it, as they are. Secondly, we muſt in confeſſing our ſinnes ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate them to the vttermoſt againſt our ſelues, and not extenuate them, as the manner is, for men to make very light of their ſinnes, and if they neuer doe worſe, they hope they ſhall doe well enough. But wee muſt labour to make our ſinnes appeare moſt vile and hainous. For ſoothing of our ſelues in ſinne, will take off the edge of our ſorrow, that we ſhall neither ſee them, nor grieue for them as we ought. And therefore,<note place="margin">

But alas, this intollerable defect neuer ſheweth it ſelfe more ſhamefully or with greater hurt, then when men ſtand moſt in neede of ſpirituall comfort, namely, at the houre of death, or in the time of ſome great affliction. For as ſhepheards that want skill to helpe a poore ſheepe out of the ditch, cut his throat in time, to make it mans meate, that it may not bee ſaid, it died in a ditch: ſo theſe miſerable comforters, are driuen to take ſome indirect courſe, whereby for want of knowledge, they ſlay many a poore ſoule. And thus in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places are the miſerable and deſperate calamities of the people prouided for, when their neceſſitie doth moſt of all require better comfort.</p>

ſatisfaction to men, but had no care to reconcile himſelfe to God, whom by his ſinne hee had moſt of all offended. It is true in this caſe, which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe. <hi>This ought hee to haue done,</hi>

               </note> VVhereupon one ſaith well, how euill a thing it is, and how carefully to bee auoided, for a man by deadly preua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication to goe about, either to retaine or to aske againe that which he hath conſecrated to God; Let <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> bee an example: whome, vnſaithfully withholding ſome part of the price of the land, not onely the voice of the Apoſtle did rebuke, but alſo the ſeueritie of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did ſlay, as inuaders of Gods right. So that if any man beeing ouercome with carnall inticements, ſhall thinke he may require that againe which is already deuoted to God, hee is not a lawfull poſſeſſor of that which is his owne, but is pronounced to be an inuader of that which appertaineth to God. And hereupon the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie</hi> telleth the people of his time, that in withholding their tithes and offerings from the <hi>Leuites,</hi> they ſpoyled God himſelfe. <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ill a man;</hi> ſaith he, <hi>spoyle his Gods? yet haue you spoyled me. But yee ſay wherein haue wee spoyled thee? in tithes and offerings.</hi> God accounteth that to be taken from himſelfe, which was either denied, or badly paid to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Leuites.</hi> The reaſon is becauſe they were occupied in Gods Miniſtrie, and God who by right might haue exacted much more at the hands of his people had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them the tithes for their wages. And indeed, there were many things in this ſinne, which were ioyned with the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20836:125"/>
proach and tontempt of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, they bewrayed themſelues to be prophane contemners of the grace of God, ſeeing they grudged to be at any coſt for thoſe things, whereby the Lord ſealed his preſence vnto them, and whereby hee teſtified that hee had ſet his houſe among them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there was a manifeſt tranſgreſſion of Gods law, who had profeſſed that their tithes were due to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21-30.</note> and that hee had giuen them to the <hi>Leuites.</hi> For ſo it is ſaid in the law. <hi>All the tithe of the land, both of the ſeede of the ground,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21.24.</note> 
               <hi>and of the fruit of the tree, is the Lords; it is holy to the Lord.</hi> And in another place: <hi>I haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Iſrael for an inheritance, for their ſeruice which they ſerue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there was groſſe ingratitude, in that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the tithes of their fruits vnto him, who by his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie had giuen them their life, and all things tending to the maintenance thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it was a token of impiety, that for their owne priuate benefite they ſuffered the <hi>Leuites</hi> to faile, and ſo the ſeruice of God to fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, it was a part of iniuſtice, to denie to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite</hi> that wages, which was due and appointed vnto them by the Lord. So plentifull and ſo manifold was this ſinne, which God in this place vpbraideth them withall. And therefore,<note place="margin">

This may very fitly be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our times. For though the <hi>Leuiticall Prieſthood</hi> bee abrogated by Chriſt, yet the miniſterie of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſtill to the end of the world.

But when ſuperſtition beganne once to grow, and the ancient diſcipline of the Church was decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then beganne many abuſes about Church reuennues. For the <hi>Pope</hi> firſt of all, alienated the property of tithes, and erected impropriations (rightly ſo called, as altogether improper for them that haue them) for the maintenance of a ſort of lazie Monks and Friers, which like <hi>Locuſts</hi> haue deuoured the Church. And this appeareth euen in our owne ſtories. For when as in the raigne of <hi>Henry the third,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> made ſuite to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate benefices might bee reſtored to then firſt vſe, at the contrary requeſt of the Monks, the <hi>Pope</hi> determined they ſhould ſtand as they did. But the <hi>Pope</hi> is not only too blame in this caſe, but many alſo of our owne Miniſters are in fault. For when ambitious ſpirits beganne to ſtriue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently for Church-liuings, they were content baſely to ſtoope on their knees, as Camels doe for their burdens: and to lay their liuings in the lap of euery <hi>Dalilah,</hi> to ſhaue at their pleaſure, and to take away from them that wherein their ſtrength conſiſted. Hence part of the tithes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uennues is ſold away, part is taken away from the Church by Noble men, and part tranſlated to other vſes, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Princes: ſo that now the poore Church of God is conſtrained, either to ſatisfie the couetouſneſſe, or to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter fewell to the prodigality of priuate perſons: and all men take pleaſure to ſpoile thoſe things, which our deuout fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers

to Lay perſons; And it is well ſpoken by one to this purpoſe: That whatſoeuer is deſigned as proper to diuine worſhip, is of right and iuſtly reputed holy; of which ſort is the Church, and all things of the Church, or belonging to it. And ſurely ſuch and ſo heauie haue been Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced and executed againſt theſe ſacrilegious Church-robbers themſelues, that by colour of their impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations depriue the godly <hi>Leuites</hi> of their proper liuings, and driue them out of their countries, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſteeme of ſuch intruders vpon the rights of Gods Church, then as men giuen ouer to the God of this world, hauing made an irrecouerable ſhipwracke of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

But they that entred into the miniſterie with a ſincere affection, and made the glorie of God and the ſaluation of his people, and not filthie lucre, the end of their preaching,<note n="a" place="margin">Honos alit artes, &amp; omnes incenduntur ad ſtudia gloria.

But not contented therewith, in a moſt furious moode, he caſt himſelfe headlong from the top of a ſteepe hill, where he lay ſwelling after a wonderfull manner, till a Cart went ouer him, and cruſhed out his guts, whereupon

the ſame with great force of wordes, ſaying: <hi>Hee will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our iniquities, and caſt all our ſinnes into the bottome of the Sea, cap.</hi> 7.19. where he alludeth vnto that great ouerthrow which the Lord gaue <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt in the red Sea.

To this purpoſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a good ſaying:<note n="a" place="margin">Qui de Deo non praeſumit veniam, non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadvertit, plus peccato ſuo Dei poſſe cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </note> that hee that hopeth not for pardon at Gods hands, doth not conſider that Gods mercy is more powerfull then his ſinne. For if he thought that God is more good, then himſelfe is euill, whatſoeuer righteouſneſſe hee findeth not in himſelfe, hee would expect him from God, that is better. And ſurely, he is diſtruſtfull, that doth not thinke the goodneſſe of the Lord to be greater then his wickedneſſe. For let him only diſtruſt, that is able to ſinne ſo much, as God is good. But ſeeing there is none that can doe this, let him that feareth, becauſe himſelfe is euil, preſume of him that is better. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, hee that diſtruſteth and compareth his wickedneſſe to Gods goodneſſe, putteth an end to the power of God, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting that which is infinite, and taking away from God the perfection of his deitie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for his iuſtice, for as much as it is fully ſatisfied in Chriſt <hi>Ieſus, who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his body on the tree: and was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for our ſinnes: and vpon whom the Lord hath laid the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of vs all;</hi> hee ſhould be very vniuſt, if hee ſhould not forgiue them vnto vs. If a man be indebted, and not able to pay the debt, if his ſuretie diſcharge it for him, and cancell the bond, there is no reaſon, the creditour ſhould exact it againe. In like manner, Chriſt our ſuretie, hauing paid that debt which wee ought to the wrath of God, and hauing cancelled <hi>the handwriting that was againſt vs,</hi> it cannot now ſtand with Gods iuſtice, to demaund the debt any more of vs. And therefore, the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>if we confeſſe our
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20836:141"/>
ſinnes as God is faithfull,</hi> in regard of his promiſe, ſo hee is <hi>iust alſo to forgiue vs our ſinnes,</hi> he will ſtand to that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which Chriſt hath made vnto his iuſtice.</p>

               <hi>his mercies are maruelous,</hi> they are <hi>tender mercies.</hi> Yea ſo large, as they <hi>reach vp to the heauens, and as high as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens are aboue the earth, ſo great is his mercy toward them that feare him.

                  <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Whether it be lawfull for a man to kill himſelfe?</note> in the laſt place, to diſcuſſe that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether it bee lawfull for any man to lay violent handes on him ſelfe, and to procure his owne death? Many cauſes there are, which driue men to theſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courſes: but they may bee reduced to two heads; either for auoiding of euill, or for procuring of good.</p>
            <p>For the firſt. Many there are, that when ſome great calamitie is either threatned againſt them, or lyeth heauie vpon them, which they thinke they are not able to beare, ſeeke to eſcape it, by offering violence to themſelues. As ſome to preuent bondage and thraldome,<note n="a" place="margin">Plutarch. in cius vita.</note> as <hi>Cato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis,</hi> becauſe hee would not bee in ſubiection to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> killed himſelfe.

Some hauing made themſelues odious in the world by their wickedneſſe, with <hi>Nero,</hi> when hee ſaw himſelfe cenſured of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and hated of all good men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20836:143"/>
to loath their liues, as being aſhamed to liue any longer. And wee haue both heard and ſeene, that many wretched miſers, hauing hoorded vp corne in hope of a dearth, when it hath fallen out contrarie to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, haue for very griefe hanged themſelues.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſome to preuent ſinne, whereunto they were like to be forced: or being forced, to ſhunne the reproach and infamie that might redound vnto them, haue killed themſelues, as <hi>Lucretia</hi> did among the <hi>Romanes,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Laſt of all, ſome not able to beare the horrour of their conſcience, by reaſon of Gods wrath, haue ſought to free themſelues, by being their owne executioners: as did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and diuers others.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond: Some in a prepoſterous deſire of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſſe, haue wilfully ſhortened their liues: As one <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> who hauing read <hi>Plato</hi> his booke of the immortalitie of the ſoule, that hee might the ſooner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to it, caſt himſelfe headlong from a wall. Others haue made away themſelues for vaine glorie, to get them a name: As <hi>Curtius</hi> among the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Maccab.</hi> 14.41.42. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Razis</hi> among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>But wee are to know, that it is not lawfull for any cauſe whatſoeuer, for a man to depriue himſelfe of life. The truth whereof may appeare by many reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, death in it ſelfe naturally is euill, inflicted vpon mankinde for a puniſhment of ſinne: yea it is one of Gods enemies, as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26.</note> 
               <hi>The laſt enemie that ſhall bee deſtroied is death?</hi> And therefore, no man ſhould wittingly and willingly procure it to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſame naturall affection, which is in all men, ſhould reſtraine them from ſo deſperate cruelty againſt themſelues. Otherwiſe they rebell againſt God, who is the author of nature; which wee ſee, the very brute beaſts will not doe. They may peraduenture goare and teare one another, but whatſoeuer extremitie they are in, they will neuer hurt themſelues. So that for a man to bee acceſſarie,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:20836:144"/>
much more principall in working his owne decay, is moſt monſtrous and vnnaturall, and moſt hainous both before God and Man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Commandement of God, that was giuen to the Fathers before <hi>Moſes,</hi> doth vtterly condemne it: where the Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5.</note> 
               <hi>I will require your bloud wherein your liues are; at the hand of euery beaſt will I require it, and at the hand of man,</hi>

               </note> is verie peremptorie in this caſe, affirming that there is neither precept nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to bee found in all the Canonicall Scriptures, that either for attaining of immortalitie, or for preuenting or auoiding of any miſerie, wee may procure our owne death. As the pleaſures of this world, though neuer ſo great, ſhould not make vs loue this life, more then wee ought: ſo all the calamities that the world can lay vpon vs, ſhould not cauſe vs to abridge the time of our life. Yea, foraſmuch as the faith of Chriſtians doth endue them with heroicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, no miſerie nor diſcontentment whatſoeuer, ſhould cauſe them to lay violent hands vpon themſelues. And indeede it is to bee feared, leaſt while by this meanes they ſeeke to ſhun a temporall calamitie, they fall into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and euerlaſting miſerie: As the fiſh that leapeth out of the boyling pan into the burning fire. And therefore if any bee ſo aſſaulted, as they begin to loath their life, and which is worſe, intend to bee more cruell to themſelues then homicides, let them remember, that they haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more to looſe then a temporall life. <hi>Woe bee to them,</hi> ſaith the wiſeman. <hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi> 2.15. <hi>that haue loſt their patience:</hi> much more in ſuch a deſperate and diſtruſtfull manner, as this is.

But when the deede is done, and the conſcience ſmitten with remorſe for it, hee ſtraightway is at hand; and that which before he extenuated, perſwading a man, that it was but a ſmall marter; now he agrauateth to the vttermoſt, and laboureth to bring the conſcience (alreadie vexed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) to vtter deſperation, and neuer leaueth, till hee cauſe the poore ſinner to make away himſelfe, vnleſſe God in his mercy preuent it. So likewiſe, when hee findeth a man oppreſſed with ſome grieuous calamity, he perſwadeth him, that God hath forſaken him, and therefore, it is beſt for him to rid himſelfe, by offering violence to his owne bodie.
